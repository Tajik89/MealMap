## 🤖What is this project?👻

This project is a program to manage **empty** and **full** tables in large 😿restaurants and eateries, which, due to the high traffic of people, the staff can hardly introduce tables to people and make them usable.

# 🧗‍♂️Why was this project created?🌳

I entered one of the big restaurants with my family.
That day, the restaurant was very busy and some people were standing to get a seat, and we were among them
Although the corner of the table is empty
But the staff didn't have the ability to quickly analyze and find space in that big hall...
This is what made me think; Why not have a program that manages these tables and instead of all the bread and butter that are standing, only one person as an operator.
Show people the first empty table..!
